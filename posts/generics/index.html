If all goes well it will be available in the Go 1.18 release. Go was intended as a language for writing server programs that would be easy to maintain over time. (See this article for more background.) The design concentrated on things like scalability, readability, and concurrency.

The topic remains open. For a look at several previous unsuccessful attempts to design a good generics solution for Go, see this proposal. Let’s take a deeper look how we got there. It all started since day 0 of go public appearance in 2010 with, in my opinin, the smart choise to not include generics in the intial language release. Soon enough go conquered some popularity and developed community around. Along with this, came endless complaints about lack of generics in go and related comparisons with Java and other languages alike. I believe, this can be explained by the developers migration from other languages and their desire to make go look like mainstream language x.\nLet’s also analyze what people wanted exactly and what asked for. Go is awesome, it has yearly official survey ritual to gather comminity opinion on various vital questions. Sad part though, there was not public go survey until year of 2016. Though, probably, it’s not that hard to find hundreds of articles with outcry complaining about lack of generics in go, daiting all the way back to the go release date. Still we will use this public surveys results as the source of the analyze. Once again, it’s a bit “fresh” and doesn’t fully represent full historical perspective of generics barganing, however it verifies the fact that genercis desire didn’t vanished within passing years. 2016 - generics are the first on What changes would improve Go most? https://blog.golang.org/survey2017-results - generics are the second? (no the first) on What changes would improve Go most? https://blog.golang.org/survey2018-results - suprissingly generics are the third on What is the biggest challenge you personally face using Go today?

I can clearly see that history of go reapts itself. It all trully reminds me sad story of godep https://peter.bourgon.org/blog/2018/07/27/a-response-about-dep-and-vgo.html where in response to community call of having package managment - “single man” steped over the heads and created, well, gomod. Don’t get me wrong resulting product “gomod” turned out to be great, but even the tech lead himself called it “community misshandling” https://twitter.com/_rsc/status/1022588240501661696?lang=en. In my eyes, generics situation is somewhat simillar. Core go team has invisioned meta programming in go and went to implement it (Veni, vidi, vici). It worth nothing now that community was successfully using code generation as main form of meta programmimg in go for years. Although, generics situation is somewhat different too. Well, it started all the same with internal contracts generic vision of https://github.com/golang/proposal/blob/master/design/go2draft-contracts.md, which expectedly got huge push back. However this time instead of forcing community to eat the pill core go team did smarter step - hire respected 3rd party to fix internal generic design (Phil Wadler: Featherweight Go) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dq0WFigax_c. This move kind of defused situation, by moving part of responsibility out of go team, and addressing weird choises from contract design\nThe problems with generics, as I see them\n#1 They make existing go type system unsound.\nGo has “limited generics” inside already (kind of) - in form of maps and slices. Introduing new form of user defined genrics that is ortoghonal to those type will make existing map and slice to not fit. Soon enough user defined vectors and maps with (better performance, better interface, better whatever) will follow, which inenventeably lead to some code base use internal containers everywhere (really knonw problem in C++).\n2 Their use case is really narrow, but they add a lot of weight to the language. Well, all knows why generics are useful - generics alghoritms and containers. The thing with go it doesn’t need neither of those that desperately. Most of the go projects are designed to be small and to use service based approach. Sure those smaller projects could benefit from generics too and they already do by using maps and slices. But they DO NOT need user defined generics most of the times, it only will bring complexity and bloat to the their code, in my opinion. Also looking back on https://blog.golang.org/survey2020-results #paste a screenshot here p90 for all applications written in go is either server side API/RPC code or data processing pipelines or some tooling around this. For all of these domains, I personally, find generics rarely useful. But what about those bigger projects _kubernetes _coacroach _etc., if you ask me on this, I’ll answer golang shouldn’t even try match their needs. Because in my opinion, it’s impossible to match n radically different requirements for n projects which size is comparable to go itself.\n3 They are impossible to take back. Generics is a huge change, maybe the biggest change that will be ever introduced to go (from cognitive perspective). And the core team desire to add generics to MINOR 1.18 version looks strange to me whatever angle I look at it. I mean, yes it “technically meets semver specification” of “version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner”, but common. I’d expect it to be MAJOR go2 release with huge implications:\n for new libraries development rewriting existing user code rewriting std library code etc.  4 They left secod half of comunity dissapointed. After years and years of go community defeneding absense of generics and learning to live with tradeoff of simplicity to features. We suddenly got 180 degree turn in 1 year. Changing people mentality and believes is not a simple process, and I’d imagine a lot of people got frustrated becuase of this turn. Subjectively, despite of surveys results, I think, that true majority of people working with go on daily basis didn’t want generics.\n5 Generic via boxing doesn’t give anything valuable to go. https://thume.ca/2019/07/14/a-tour-of-metaprogramming-models-for-generics/\n",

<p>Just briefly scratching the surface of these proposals and designs. I can clearly see that history of go reapts itself.
It all trully reminds me sad story of godep <a href="https://peter.bourgon.org/blog/2018/07/27/a-response-about-dep-and-vgo.html">https://peter.bourgon.org/blog/2018/07/27/a-response-about-dep-and-vgo.html</a>
where in response to community call of having package managment - &ldquo;single man&rdquo; steped over the heads and created, well, gomod.

<p>Well, all knows why generics are useful - generics alghoritms and containers. The thing with go it doesn&rsquo;t need neither of those that desperately.
Most of the go projects are designed to be small and to use service based approach. Sure those smaller projects could benefit from generics too and they already do by using maps and slices.
But they DO NOT need user defined generics most of the times, it only will bring complexity and bloat to the their code, in my opinion. Also looking back on <a href="https://blog.golang.org/survey2020-results">https://blog.golang.org/survey2020-results</a> #paste a screenshot here
p90 for all applications written in go is either server side API/RPC code or data processing pipelines or some tooling around this. For all of these domains, I personally, find generics rarely useful.
But what about those bigger projects _kubernetes _coacroach _etc., if you ask me on this, I&rsquo;ll answer golang shouldn&rsquo;t even try match their needs.
Because in my opinion, it&rsquo;s impossible to match n radically different requirements for n projects which size is  comparable to go itself.</p>

<p>Generics is a huge change, maybe the biggest change that will be ever introduced to go (from cognitive perspective). And the core team desire to add generics to MINOR 1.18 version looks strange to me whatever angle I look at it.
I mean, yes it &ldquo;technically meets semver specification&rdquo; of &ldquo;version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner&rdquo;, but common. I&rsquo;d expect it to be MAJOR go2 release with huge implications:</p>
<ul>
<li>for new libraries development</li>
<li>rewriting existing user code</li>
<li>rewriting std library code</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>After years and years of go community defeneding absense of generics and learning to live with tradeoff of simplicity to features. We suddenly got 180 degree turn in 1 year.
Changing people mentality and believes is not a simple process, and I&rsquo;d imagine a lot of people got frustrated becuase of this turn. Subjectively, despite of surveys results, I think,
that true majority of people working with go on daily basis didn&rsquo;t want generics.</p>
